      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Annyan Swarnkar and I am a game artist from India. I have been working in the industry for a total of 4 years, with 1.5 years of experience working for a company and 2.5 years as a freelance artist.

        As a game artist, I specialize in creating 3D assets, animations and visual effects for video games. I have a strong understanding of industry-standard software such as Blender, Photoshop, and Unreal Engine 5. My skills include character modeling, texturing, rigging, and animation. I am also familiar with game engines such as Unity.
        
        In my experience working for a company, I have gained valuable experience working in a team environment, as well as honing my skills in project management, and meeting tight deadlines. As a freelancer, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and develop my skills as a freelancer, gaining experience in project management, client management, and delivering high-quality assets and animations.
        
        I am highly motivated and dedicated to creating high-quality assets that exceed expectations. I am a proactive problem-solver and a quick learner, always looking to improve my skills and take on new challenges. I am always available to discuss any potential projects or opportunities.
        
        Thank you for considering me for your project or team.</p>
